Turn any Pushword page into ready-to-post social carousels (LinkedIn, Instagram,
Facebook, Pinterest, Threads). A carousel is a small JSON **spec**; the package
renders it to **self-contained SVG slides** server-side — font and image embedded
as `data:` URIs — so a slide is one portable file that rasterises to a pixel-exact
PNG in any browser.

Because the text is laid out in PHP, **overflow and bad crops become validation
errors before anything is rendered** — the property that makes carousels safe to
author by an AI agent.

## Install

```bash
composer require pushword/repurpose
```

It requires `ext-gd` (text measurement) and `ext-zip` (export). Imagick is **not**
required — the export PDF is written in pure PHP.

## How it fits together

```
Page ──► CarouselDrafter ──► SocialPost ◄──► social-post/{page}/{network}.json
                                  ▲
                                  └── admin studio / REST API / AI agent
                                     │
                                     ▼
                        SlideRenderer + TextLayout (PHP)
                                     │
                                     ▼
                   self-contained SVG  →  PNG (browser)  →  .zip + .pdf
```

- **Spec** — a JSON document (slides, text, focal-point crop, palette, font
  pairing, background effect, status). The `Carousel` model + Symfony Validator are
  the single source of truth, shared by the renderer, the CLI lint and the API.
- **Storage** — a `SocialPost` row (so the admin can list "everything planned this
  week", filter by status, enforce per-network uniqueness) that also round-trips as
  a flat JSON file through `pw:flat:sync`. Works on a DB-first site and a flat-file
  site alike.
- **Studio** — an admin page (`/admin/repurpose`) that previews the deck and
  exports it.

## Author with an agent (recommended)

There is no LLM inside the package. An agent writes the spec against a published
schema and validates it — free, with whatever model you already use.

1. `GET /api/repurpose/schema` — the JSON shape (keys, enums, ranges).
2. `GET /api/repurpose/networks` — formats (ratio/pixels), per-network **hard
   limits** (errors) vs **guidance** (advice), and font pairings — each with an
   `installed` flag; only pick installed ones (the rest fall back to Roboto).
3. `POST /api/repurpose/validate` — validate a spec, get precise
   `{path, message}` violations (overflow, out-of-bounds crop, disallowed format…)
   plus non-blocking `warnings` (e.g. text/background contrast below WCAG AA).
4. `PUT /api/repurpose/{host}/{network}/{page}` — save it. The response echoes the
   persisted slide count, the warnings, and `studioUrl` / `previewUrl` /
   `slideUrls` so the result can be confirmed and eyeballed without a follow-up GET.
5. `GET /api/repurpose/{id}/preview.png` — the whole deck as one contact-sheet
   PNG, slides sized to the network's **mobile feed width** (`feedMobile` in
   `/api/repurpose/networks`, e.g. ~390px, Pinterest's two-column grid ~186px) so
   text legibility is judged at the realistic worst case. Needs Chromium on the
   host; without it, a 501 points back at the SVGs.
   Or `GET /api/repurpose/{id}/slide-{n}.svg` for one slide.

The [`pw` ai-skill](https://github.com/Pushword/Pushword/tree/main/packages/ai-skills)
ships a `carousel` playbook for exactly this loop.

## Command line

```bash
bin/console pw:repurpose:schema                 # print the JSON Schema
bin/console pw:repurpose:validate spec.json     # lint a spec (precise violations, non-zero exit)
bin/console pw:repurpose:render spec.json out/  # render to out/slide-1.svg …
bin/console pw:repurpose:fonts                  # list font pairings + installed status
bin/console pw:repurpose:fonts bebas-neue-lato  # install a pairing's TTFs (or --all)
```

All emit compact JSON when run by an AI agent (`--format=agent`).

## Cropping

The crop is three numbers on a slide's `image`: `focusX`/`focusY` (0..1 focal
point in the source) and `zoom` (≥ 1). It is applied at **render time** as an SVG
clip — never baked into a cached file — so the same numbers stay correct when the
slide is re-rendered at another format's ratio. A landscape photo in a portrait
slide is simply a wide image the frame clips.

## Fonts

Six pairings ship with the package (DM Serif Display+DM Sans, Playfair+Chivo,
Montserrat+Work Sans, Poppins+Inter, Anton+Roboto, Lora+Ubuntu); the other ~45 —
all Google Fonts — are installed on demand with `pw:repurpose:fonts <pairing>`
into `repurpose.font_dir` (defaults to `var/repurpose/fonts`, app-side so a
composer update never wipes them). A pairing that is not installed falls back to
Roboto — check the `installed` flag in `GET /api/repurpose/networks` (or
`pw:repurpose:fonts`) before picking one. Fonts must be local files:
`imagettfbbox` measures a file on disk, and an SVG rasterised for canvas export
cannot fetch remote resources.

## Legibility

A spec can be valid yet unreadable — dark `palette.text` over a photo is the
classic trap. Two guards: a slide with an image and no stated `overlay` defaults
to `0.35` (an explicit `0` is honoured), and `validate` / `PUT` / the studio
preview return non-blocking contrast `warnings` (WCAG AA large-text, 3:1) naming
the slide and the fix. Warnings never block a save — a deliberate low-contrast
design stays possible.

## Creator byline

Slides can carry a byline (avatar + name + role, top-left; `creatorOnSlides`
picks which slides, `creatorOrientation` puts the text beside the avatar or
stacked under it). `creator` is either a key from the site's
`repurpose_creators` config:

```yaml
pushword:
  apps:
    - hosts: [example.com]
      repurpose_creators:
        jane:
          name: 'Jane Doe'
          role: 'Editor in chief'
          avatar: 'jane.jpg' # a media file name; optional
```

…or an inline `{name, role?, avatar?, type?}` object for a one-off byline.
Omitted, the brand (site name) signs. An **unknown key** falls back to the brand
too, but `PUT` and the studio preview flag it with a non-blocking warning
listing the known keys — the same channel as contrast warnings. Without an
avatar (or when the media is missing) the byline renders an initials disc, never
a broken image. The studio offers the configured creators in a dropdown; a
downstream app with richer author data can bind its own
`CreatorResolverInterface` (implement `resolve()` plus `available()`, which
feeds that dropdown and the warning).

## Export

The studio rasterises each self-contained SVG to a PNG in the browser and posts
them back; the server assembles a `.zip` (PNGs + `caption.txt`) plus, for LinkedIn,
a multipage `carousel.pdf` — written in pure PHP, no Imagick, so it works on shared
hosting and the FrankenPHP static binary.

## Networks and formats

Platform specs drift, so formats are editable data with a provenance note, and the
validator enforces only **hard limits** (LinkedIn ≤300 pages / ≤100 MB / all pages
one size; Instagram ≤20 slides), never engagement opinions. Fetch the live table
from `GET /api/repurpose/networks`.
